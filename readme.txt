Send event tickets sold via Tickera to attendees 

== Description ==

Tickera is a great plugin to sell tickets for your events and managing those events. This plugin is an add-on to Tickera's functionality. By default Tickera sends email only to buyer of the tickets. This add-on plugin adds functionality to send tickets to attendees (ticket owner) as well. Attendee will receive a link to his/her own ticket only via an email. The email template is hard coded right now. If you guys need to customize the template, reach out. I will add admin menu page from where you can customize the email template to be sent. For this add-on plugin to work you should have Tickera plugin installed and "Tickera > Settings > General > Show Ticket Attendee Fields" set to YES.

In case you face difficulties in email delivery (email not delivered or delivered to junk), I recommend you use a plugin like Easy WP STMP.

== Installation ==

1. First purchase, install and activate Tickera (by Tickera.com) https://wordpress.org/plugins/tickera-event-ticketing-system/
2. Once Tickera is active, Go To "Tickera > Settings > General > Show Ticket Attendee Fields" and set it to YES. Refer screenshot-1.png
3. Now install AG Tickera Email Attendees using any of your preferred methods.
4. Activate plugin. That's it. Your ticket owners/attendees will receive their tickets via email entered in the email field of Attendee info.
